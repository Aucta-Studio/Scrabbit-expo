# Scrabbit-expo
## The main social media app that was deployed on expo
Scrabbit is an augmented reality scrapbooking platform that allows users to upload and share their scrapbooks with each other, creating a unique and interactive experience for everyone. Scrabbit includes a range of tools and resources to help users create and share their scrapbooks. Users can edit and draw on their scrapbooks, and can easily upload their own photos and mementos to personalize their scrapbook. Once their scrapbook is complete, users can share it with friends and family via the app, allowing them to experience their memories together in a way that is truly unique.


##### 1.1. Purpose
This report is a breakdown of Scrabbit, as presented by Aucta Studio, to examine the application in its current
state, before delivery to the customer. The project Scrabbit is an application created for SIFT, as requested by
Dr Rick Freedman, a member of SIFT and customer for Heriot-Watt’s third year project. Scrabbit is an
augmented reality scrapbooking platform as a safe alternative to metaverses for people to document, organize,
annotate, and share memories with others through the integration and overlaying of real-world content. This
application is intended for use by the general public; unregistered users may view some of the application’s
public content; however, users must first create an account to fully utilize the application. 


##### 1.2. Scope
We, at Aucta Studio, created a scrapbooking application, called Scrabbit. This project aims to develop a
scrapbooking platform with an integrated Augmented Reality map. Scrabbit is a completely functional
application with a database. The main purpose of the application is to allow users to create scrapbooks to
document their memories, journal and interact with other scrapbooks. The application has sections that allow the
users to create scrapbooks, view and interact with scrapbooks created by other users. The database will store
necessary information about the users and their scrapbooks. The application will have a user-friendly design.
